## Node.js Tasks
In this series of Tasks, you are going to create native HTTP servers in Node.js which will handle different kinds of application logics.



### Tasks
Recommended order of attempting the tasks.
1. Todo List App
2. File Server
3. Authentication System

#### Notes
1. If you are unable to understand the request/response of any task file or whatever the way it is being tested, you can take a look at its respective test file present in `tests/` directory.
2. Don't try to make any changes to the test files present in the `tests/` directory.
3. To make sure that you have not missed any task you can run a final test command in terminal `npm run test-all`.
4. Don't make any changes to the code already present in files including function/method/class signatures and module exports.

#### Development Setup
1. Install the dependencies used by running `npm install` command in your terminal.
2. We used `18.x.y` Node.js version, if anything doesn't work then please consider upgrading your node installation.
